- **[WSL and Docker config](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/).**
- **[WSL connection through a development environment (VS code)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack). The point is to be able to enter linux and access the project files.**
- **Select any folder for example: `/home/user/` and pull down via git.**
- **Entering the root of the project `./vendor/bin/sail up` which starts the Docker container (it may take a long time for the first start!).**
- **Then installation via sail commands: `./vendor/bin/sail composer install`, `./vendor/bin/sail npm install`, `./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev`.**
